          Hi, I'm Matias Velazquez or, as most people know me, Mavevisuals, a 21
          -year-old photographer from a small town in Chile. 
          <br />
          <br />
          By now, I have been doing photography for about 5 years and I really enjoy it.
          It all started by taking photos of landscapes, people and everyday situations 
          as always. But as I got older, my view of the world was constantly updated. 
          And it is reflected in the concept of beauty that I wanted. I started to create 
          different magical scenes and save images of them using a camera. 
          <br />
          <br />I believe that my photography demonstrates the beauty of each of the situations 
          and people. I try to share all my feelings, the ones you felt when I was taking my 
          camera to capture the moment. So I want people to forget about all the bad things in 
          their life and be able to express who they are.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>Join me in this incredible journey!âœ¨</span>
